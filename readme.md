# natHacks EEG P300 Truth Elicitor

### The P300
- The P300 is a specific signature in the brain that is typically seen when a subject is exposed to an oddball stimulus. We leverage this by flashing images on a screen to generate many instances of this signal, then analyzing slight differences in the P300 response for different types of stimuli.

### General Setup

1. The subject plays the role of a convicted criminal. We know they had an accomplice, and we have narrowed the search down to **10 suspects**.

2. The subject will be presented with 10 folded pieces of paper. Each piece of paper has a different face on it. The subject will choose one of these 10 images, such that only they know which image they have chosen. This will be the face of their accomplice.

3. To properly assume their role, the subject will be briefed on their relationship with their accomplice, so as to generate an emotional association with the image of their accomplice.

4. The subject will then engage with the Truth Elicitor by looking at the **GUI**. They will press a button whenever they see a **Target**, which they have seen before. The purpose of this is to have a reference to compare each suspect against.

##### GUI
- once initiated, the GUI will display a countdown from 10.
- the GUI will then flash images of faces on the screen at regular intervals but in a randomized order. 10 of these images correspond to "suspects," while the other 50 are merely random faces the subject has never seen before.
- the user will then react as rapidly as possible to press the physical button corresponding to the image displayed on screen
- the process then repeats for the desired number of iterations

##### Data Collection
- the user will wear an EEG headset while engaging with the truth elicitor
- when a particular image is shown to the user, the EEG response to that image will be recorded and associated with that image
- the average EEG response to each image will be accumulated and averaged over time for analysis

##### EEG Configuration
- CH1-C3, CH2-Cz, CH3-C4, CH4-P3, CH5-Pz, CH6-P4, CH7-O1, CH8-O2
- 4th order butterworth bandpass filter between 1 Hz and 12.5 Hz

##### Data Analysis
- We make use of a Probe-Target-Irrelevant (PTI) design, which we analyze via Bootstrap Correlation Difference. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260708002484)
- For each of the 10 suspects, the brain data generated from this suspect flashing on the screen is correlated against the equivalent brain data for the target image, as well as against the data for a random sample of "irrelevant" images (images we know are not potential accomplices).
- If the signal is more highly correlated with the average Target Signal than the average Irrelevant Signal, we add 1 point to its score. If not, we add 0 points. We repeat this many times.
- Whichever image has the highest score is deemed to generate signals most similar to those generated by the Target Stimulus. We identify this as the Probe -- in other words, we have found their accomplice!
